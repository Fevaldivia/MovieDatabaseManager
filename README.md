# MovieDatabaseManager

With this app you can use themoviedb.org to ad favorites movies to your profile or look for movies that you would like to watch, 
this project was created with Udacity help providing the design elements, we use OAuth authentication so we can log in directly with your
themoviedb user.

# Run this project

This project was build with Swift 4 and you are going to need an account in themoviedb to get authenticate in the app, I dont provide the
API key either so be aware to include that in the Constants file to make this project work. 

# Why?

The idea of this project is to put in practice everything that I learned with Udacity nanodegree in iOS and manipulate data from an API
is a basic and fun app to use.
